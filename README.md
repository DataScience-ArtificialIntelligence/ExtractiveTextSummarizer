# ExtractiveTextSummarizer

## This project is involved in dealing with the mechanism and the effectiveness of the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model for text summarization. Our study examines the working of the component blocks and the sublayers used by T5. It also examines the impact of hyperparameters and dataset characteristics on T5’s efficiency to summarize. The results demonstrate T5’s ability to extract summaries from the input text, making use of the optimized parameters for enhanced performance.This research contributes valuable insights to the application of transformer-based models in text summarization, providing a detailed guide for researchers.
